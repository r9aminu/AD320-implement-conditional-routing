# How Express Conditional Routing is implemented

This is a simple Node.js Express server that demonstrates conditional routing based on random responses.

## How to Run the Server

Follow these steps to run the server:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

3. **Install Dependencies:**

4. **Start the Server:**


5. **Access the Server:**
Open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/foo](http://localhost:3000/foo).

6. **Testing Routes:**
- Access the `/foo` route multiple times to observe the random responses.
- Access undefined routes to see the 404 - Not Found response.

7. **Stop the Server:**
To stop the server, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the server is running.

## Conditional Routing Explanation

In this Express server, conditional routing is implemented as follows:

- When a user accesses the `/foo` route, the server generates a random number between 0 and 1.
- If the random number is less than 0.5, it sends the response "sometimes this" to the user.
- If the random number is greater than or equal to 0.5, it passes control to the next route.
- A second route for `/foo` responds with "and sometimes that," providing an alternative response when control is passed.

- For undefined routes, a 404 error handler is set up to respond with "404 - Not Found."

Feel free to explore the code in the `app.js` file for a more detailed understanding of the implementation.
